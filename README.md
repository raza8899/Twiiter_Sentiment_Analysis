# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
A project based on classification, classifying the tweets into hate and non-hate. I have used various ML Algorithms like Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest and SVM. Various algorithms for feature extraction are also used like Bags-of-Words, TF-IDF , Word2Vec, Doc2Vec
The training date contains 'Label' where '0' means non-hate tweet and '1' indicates a hate tweets.
I have used Ipython Notebook for this project.
